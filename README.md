# rscplus-replay-sleepword-pngs-clean
Sleepword files pulled from https://github.com/2003scape/rsc-captcha-archives/tree/master/rscplus-replay-sleepwords/png that were not incorrect or suddenly awake, with better file names. Does not include some ~300 sleepword files in that pngs folder that were too long for Windows.
